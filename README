Chirp Benchmark 3.0
===================

Use the Chirp Python script to generate a benchmark file that is formatted as below:

- Tab-separated
- Each line contains:
	- a timestamp, in milliseconds
	- a command:
		- w for writes
		- rp for reads on primary key
		- rs for reads on secondary key
	- a value:
		- a JSON tweet object for writes
		- one or two primary key(s)
		- one or two secondary key(s)

Just execute 'run_chirp.py' on the command line with the required parameters. Check out the example for more details.

A visual walkthrough is available at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~ameno002/benchmark/.

Try './run_chirp.py --help' for usage.
