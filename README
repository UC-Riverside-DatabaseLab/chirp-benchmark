Chirp Benchmark 0.3
===================

Use the Chirp Python script to generate a benchmark file that is formatted as below:

- Tab-separated
- Each line contains:
	- a timestamp, in milliseconds
	- a command:
		- w for writes
		- rp for reads on primary key
		- rs for reads on secondary key
	- a value:
		- a JSON tweet object for writes
		- a tweet 'ID' for reads on primary key
		- a tweet 'UserID' for reads on secondary key

Just run 'benchmark_gen.py' on the command line with the required parameters. Check out the example for more details.

Try './benchmark_gen.py --help' for usage.
